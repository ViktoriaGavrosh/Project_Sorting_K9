# Project_Sorting_K9
This project created during the learning process

This program processes textual and numeric 
data and sorts it. Itâ€™s possible to sort 
numbers, words and lines. 

There are two  sorting types: natural and  
sorting by count, a type of sorting that 
arranges the elements by number of occurrences.

The command-line arguments define the input 
data type  and sorting type:

"-dataType long" - numbers

"-dataType line" - lines

"-dataType word" - words

If the argument is not provided - argument 
is word.

"-sortingType natural" 

"-sortingType byCount"

If the argument is not provided, then consider 
natural to be the default sorting type.

"-inputFile input.txt" - reads the input data 
from the file.

"-outputFile out.txt" - prints the results 
to the file.
